    <h2>Who we are</h2>
Our website address is: http://sue-a-darby.com/learning.
<h1>THIS SITE IS HAND CODED AND THERE IS NO DATA COLLECTED! THIS IS A SAMPLE POLICY BASED ON ONE OF MY WORDPRESS WEBSITES.</h1>
<h2>What personal data we collect and why we collect it</h2>
<h3>Comments</h3>
There is no mechanism for leaving comments on this portion of the site so we don't collect anything.
When visitors leave comments on the site we collect the data shown in the comments form, and also the visitorâ€™s IP address and browser user agent string to help spam detection.

This really really doesn't apply since we don't have a comments area at this time.
An anonymized string created from your email address (also called a hash) may be provided to the Gravatar service to see if you are using it. The Gravatar service privacy policy is available here: https://automattic.com/privacy/. After approval of your comment, your profile picture is visible to the public in the context of your comment.
<h3>Media</h3>
YOU as a visitor can't upload ANYTHING so DO NOT EVEN TRY! If you choose to download one of MY images at least link back to my sites! 
If you upload images to the website, you should avoid uploading images with embedded location data (EXIF GPS) included. Visitors to the website can download and extract any location data from images on the website.
<h3>Contact forms</h3>
Contact is done via LinkedIn, FaceBook or even Twitter but NOT on this site. Each of those sites has their own policies that I do NOT control.
<h3>Cookies</h3>
There are no comments allowed here so there are no cookies. Check your browser there is nothing saved for this site. 
If you leave a comment on our site you may opt-in to saving your name, email address and website in cookies. These are for your convenience so that you do not have to fill in your details again when you leave another comment. These cookies will last for one year.

If you have an account and you log in to this site, we will set a temporary cookie to determine if your browser accepts cookies. This cookie contains no personal data and is discarded when you close your browser.

When you log in, we will also set up several cookies to save your login information and your screen display choices. Login cookies last for two days, and screen options cookies last for a year. If you select "Remember Me", your login will persist for two weeks. If you log out of your account, the login cookies will be removed.

If you edit or publish an article, an additional cookie will be saved in your browser. This cookie includes no personal data and simply indicates the post ID of the article you just edited. It expires after 1 day.
<h3>Embedded content from other websites</h3>
Articles on this site may include embedded content (e.g. videos, images, articles, etc.). Embedded content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other website.

These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracing your interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that website.
<h3>Analytics</h3>
Eventually I will add this sub-site to my Google Analytics just to see how many people actually visit it but other than that I don't care to keep your data or look deeper as this is a sample site only.
<h2>Who we share your data with</h2>
Not likely to share data with anyone unless you count the cat!
<h2>How long we retain your data</h2>
You can't leave a comment so I don't have your data to give back to you.
If you leave a comment, the comment and its metadata are retained indefinitely. This is so we can recognize and approve any follow-up comments automatically instead of holding them in a moderation queue.

For users that register on our website (if any), we also store the personal information they provide in their user profile. All users can see, edit, or delete their personal information at any time (except they cannot change their username). Website administrators can also see and edit that information.
<h2>What rights you have over your data</h2>
There are no accounts so I have no data to give you. Nor are there comments so I can't help you there either. 
If you have an account on this site, or have left comments, you can request to receive an exported file of the personal data we hold about you, including any data you have provided to us. You can also request that we erase any personal data we hold about you. This does not include any data we are obliged to keep for administrative, legal, or security purposes.
<h2>Where we send your data</h2>
I don't have comments so there is no SPAM! YAY ME! Visitor comments may be checked through an automated spam detection service.
<h2>Your contact information</h2>
Again contacting me is via LinkedIn, Twitter or FaceBook NOT here.
<h2>Additional information</h2>
This is just a test site!
<h3>How we protect your data</h3>
I DO NOT HAVE YOUR DATA!
<h3>What data breach procedures we have in place</h3>
I DO NOT HAVE YOUR DATA!
<h3>What third parties we receive data from</h3>
There are no third parties for this site.
<h3>What automated decision making and/or profiling we do with user data</h3>
NO DATA NO PROFLINIG!
<h3>Industry regulatory disclosure requirements</h3>
AHAHAHAH NO DATA!
