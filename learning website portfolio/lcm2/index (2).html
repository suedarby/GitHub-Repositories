<p class="bio"> Lady Code Monkey is learning the basics of what she needs to develop websites and applications for the internet. She has a good grasp of HTML & CSS already as she has been working in it since the 90's. She is looking to move into her long lost love of programming as a restart of a career moving away from being a geek for the government</p>
