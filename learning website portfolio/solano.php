It is a local community college and where I learned the art of pattern making by computer as well as a love of teaching computer skills. This was where I learned to draft in miniature, sew tiny, fine rolled hems on silk and a multitude of other skills. Sadly my instructor has retired and I've lost contact with her. You can see the results of my pattern skills and even some of my technical writing and computer skills at <a href ="http://www.suestinycostumes.com" class="btn btn-primary">Sue's Tiny Costumes</a>.</p></p>
