                <p class="card-text">Sue's Tiny Costumes is my oldest site. It started in the days of Geocities as did my skills with website building. I showcase my doll patterns which are very tiny and complex in some ways yet ultimately beautiful. I have used this site to learn how to setup a manual e-commerce shopping cart, learn WordPress and even graphic design. There are 100 patterns and 2 books published and available for sale on the site.</p>

My daughter's Senior Prom Dress was no exception. Normally I do all this work for smaller models... 5 1/2" to 18" dolls but my daughter is one of my original dolls so making this dress was special and a lot of work!</p>

            <h5 class="card-title">Application Tracker</h5>
            <p class="card-text">The Application Tracker was built in Sharepoint as a stop gap, band-aid approach to the need to track incoming Certification Applications. Since it was my original idea I chose to use SharePoint for several reasons. First was the need for more than one person to be in the system either entering, editing or viewing data. Second the way the State had SharePoint setup it was auto backed up and if something went wrong there were ways to recover data. It was also as I learned over the couple years it was in use, expandable for data collection. I could also develop reports and export the data for management to get an idea of what was going on and who had what application at what phase in the process. The downside was that the rest of the team was not as dilligent in updating as I was so data cleaning had to happen often. Overall it was a more reliable tool than using Excel and was the only working database the team had for a week during the new system changeover. Many of the datapoints recorded in the Application Tracker were incorporated into the new system as well.</p>

            <h5 class="card-title">Compliance Tool</h5>
            <p class="card-text">The compliance tool is actually a series of tools built to support the Provider Settings Compliance Project at the State of Alaska. First was a spreadsheet template developed to capture the results of a survey, the results of a in person visit to the site location and ultimately used to drive a mail merge process for a series of compliance notifications. As the project moved forward more things were added to track the incoming and out going data. The mail merge process included conversion of Word documents to fill in PDFs which resulted in another spreadsheet with a custom macro designed to email the PDF files via Excel and Outlook. The last portion was a data tracking tool to help with reporting on the status of compliance as the number of providers the team was tracking numbered over 800 and kept climbing as discoveries happened.</p>

            <h5 class="card-title">Certification Checklist</h5>
            <p class="card-text">The Certification Checklist is a tool that started as a humble Word Document by a reviewer as a personal tool to aid in processing applications. During a regulation change it became both a mandatory tool and a far more complex tool built originally by another co-worker who moved on. It was assigned to my care as it was my main tool for the intake process. Many times I was asked to tweak language, update requirements and even program in new requirements. As a result it became a 400 lines of VB.Net code juggernaut. When I was in the process of leaving the State I asked the team for a wishlist of things they'd like me to try to build before I went. My last two days were spend coding a much simpler variation of the checklist and training other team members on how to modify the code. The last I heard my training and documentation for how to do it was successful as the tool had already started being updated less than a month after I was gone!</p>

            <p class="card-text">The State has several types of providers who were previously “invisible” to management statistically. We knew they exist but really did not know exactly who they were or where the clients were. Frequently, the clients served were placed in a wrong environment and all sorts of havoc would happen when something went wrong.</p></p>

                <p>When we had a change of regulations in 2013, that prompted a big change in our database, which in turn broke a few things including a web based interactive search tool. This was the business document I was asked to develop upon my discovery of the broken tool. It not only fixed the issue, it added some improved functionality that the division had wanted for a couple years.</p>
