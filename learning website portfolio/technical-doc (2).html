            This tutorial was originally created in 2000-2001 and tested on my
            daughter at about a year old (she's 20 now). I have also used this
            tutorial to draft for a doll as small as 1/2" tall, of course using
            magnifying glasses and a very sharp pencil! This is a preview of the
            techniques used in

            which were originally sold as hard copy books, moved to CD and are
            now available only in PDF as an instant download. Included in this
            tutorial series are excerpts all the items that will be needed for
            all the pattern drafts for a child doll. It is suitable for a 6" or
            taller doll.

            Each of the following sections will include the first portion of
            each draft with a link to the full tutorial which has been published
            on Sue's Tiny Costumes for 20 years. This is the longest and was the
            easiest to tranlate into this project to use as a sample of both
            writing and code work for the project.

            Below is the supply list you will need to draft patterns for small
            or miniature children dolls. In future posts I willalso try to list
            places to find some of the more unique items such as miniature
            French Curves suitable for drafting in the smaller scales.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>1/8 or 1/4″ Ribbon</strong> -used to mark where the bust
              waist and hips land so that measurements are accurate. To help
              measure hard to get into places on small dolls. You can lay the
              ribbon on the doll and then use a pen dot to mark the desired
              amount and then measure the end to the dot.
            </li>
            <li>
              A <strong>plastic coated twist tie</strong> works very well for
              very tiny dolls as you can bend the wire to the exact amount you
              need and then use a ruler to do the measuring
            </li>
            <li><strong>Eraser</strong>– pink pearl or kneaded gum</li>
            <li>
              <strong>French Curve</strong>, tape dispenser, or sets of “doll
              size” French curves
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Glue stick</strong> helps hold tiny pieces to cardstock
              for final blocks
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Light Table</strong> or A Box with a Light Inside and
              Clear Glass or Plastic Over the Top or A Child’s Light Table –
              used for tracing patterns easier
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Magnifying glass</strong> Lets you see small things easier
            </li>

            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Measuring Tape</strong> – a normal sized human one works
              well. Alternately the retractable purse size measuring tape found
              at Wal-Mart works very well too.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Muslin</strong>– relatively inexpensive way to do test
              fits and be able to sew the pieces together along with marking on
              the pieces any changes*Paper- light weight for first drafts of the
              pattern
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Paper Towel,</strong> muslin, used dryer sheets-
              inexpensive way to test patterns
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Pencil</strong>- mechanical pencil or a no. 2 normal
              pencil with a sharp point
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Ruler</strong> – an accurate one marked in 1/16ths and
              also centimeters (metal is best) There are clear rulers that are
              marked in 1/10ths that are very useful as well

              paper and another pair for fabric

              fine line that is more visible than pencil to a final pattern
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Xacto Knife</strong>– to aid cutting out permanent blocks

          <p>Since most dolls are evenly made on both sides, the measurements are taken on the half or in the case of an arc the quarter. The exception is circumference  measurements, which are all the way around the body. It is advisable that you mark somehow, either with scotch tape on the body and a pencil mark or however you are comfortable, the center  front and back along with where your doll’s bust, waist and hip fall. Deciding this before you start measuring will make a big difference in how your patterns will turn out and how accurate they will be. For scale and 1/2 scale miniatures use metrics, as a millimeter is more accurate than rounding to the nearest fraction. When working with dolls this tiny it is imperative that your measurements be accurate. </p>

          <p>Now we get into the actual activity in preparation for drafting a pattern. This explains how to make the measurements correctly the chart.</p>
          <p>Take ribbon and pass it around your doll’s waist, bust or chest, neck and hips. Fasten ends together. Choose to use either the top or the bottom of each piece of ribbon as a guide for where you are starting or stopping a measurement. You may also want to mark in pencil or pen the center front and back for reference too. This section of the book deals specifically with measuring different types of dolls and all of the explanations are included in one place.</p>

        <p><strong>Finger type </strong>What type of fingers your doll has- a mitt, some fingers spread or  individual fingers.

        <p>Guidelines are simply lines of undetermined length to provide a place to measure or draw a line to. They are not precise and do not have set lengths, most however, do need to be a squared (90°angle) angle from another line.</p>

          <p>Here are some suggestions for some common items that can make drafting and sewing for smaller dolls easier!</p>
          <p><strong>Dryer sheet</strong>— can be used for any spot that requires interfacing of sorts as in collars and cuffs but should not be used for the entire garment. I have tried it several times and cutting it away sometimes ends in holes in the actual garment no matter how careful I am.</p>
          <p><strong>Tear away stabilizer</strong>— this is useful for china silk that is slightly heavy yet still slippery. The bad thing is that tearing it away sometimes will distort the stitching and fabric.</p>
          <p><strong>Water Soluble stabilizer</strong>— my latest discovery! This stuff is easy to use simply trace the pieces to the stabilizer and construct the garment. When ready to get rid of the stabilizer simply dunk in cold water and it all dissolves like magic leaving soft silk in it’s place. It is also handy to use in bodice construction as when you turn bodices sometimes pointy or even dull tools can poke through the fabric the stabilizer helps to prevent this thus avoiding the ruin of a lot of work! So far I haven’t found a downside to this yet.</p>
          <p>The 2 stabilizers mentioned above are available in the machine embroidery section of any sewing or craft store and  are usually very light weight. My current packages of both the Tear Away and the Water Soluable (Solvy) are by Sulky. No I do not sell the items mentioned I just use it and love it!</p>
          <p>Machine basting patterns to fabric is a lot of work. I’ve found that hand basting is faster and less of a hassle as  you do not have to pin the pieces to the fabric first. Slightly larger stitches are ok for this too as you want to  be able to see to take them out later!</p>
          <p>Best tools I’ve found so far are crochet hooks. A size 5 crochet hook has a blunt butt end that is smaller than a
            bodkin which is useful also but the crochet hook also has a rounded end by the hook that is great for getting bodice
            pieces to turn nicely too. This is especially important for half inch scale bodices!</p>
          <p>Got small kids in the house? I do!  Mischief makers both. Now being that I sew and do it A LOT I use needles
            and pins…. standard pin cushions don’t babyproof enough to suit me. My solution is to take the nice childproof
            prescription medicine bottles and put pins and needles in those. I have a nice fat one for pins and several skinny
            ones for various types of needles including sewing machine needles. This makes good storage…. and the kids can’t get
            into them!</p>
          <p>Alternate to ribbon for measuring small dolls accurately is a twist tie.To measure simply place one end at the
            starting point and the other end you bend then measure the tiny portion before the bend against an accurate ruler.

        <header>Fractions to MM</header>
        <article>
        <div class="entry-content">
          <p>This chart and a full conversion tool can be found on <a title="Conversion Calculator"  href="http://www.sengpielaudio.com/calculator-cminch.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://www.sengpielaudio.com/calculator-cminch.htm</a> I thank this site for having the information I needed for this tutorial!</p>
          <p>Due to the many requests I’ve had during classes on information about metrics vs standard measuring I decided that a tutorial was necessary for measuring in metrics as it is more accurate for very small dolls.</p>
          <p>To use the chart found at the link:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Fractions are obvious I would guess.</li>
            <li>The decimal was found by dividing 1 by the number after the / so 1 divided by 64 gives you the .0156.</li>
            <li>The MM was found by multiplying by 2.54. To read the MM section correctly you read after the decimal as mm and before the . as CM. Thus 1.3 cm is 1 centimeters and 3 millimeters.</li>
            <li>My books and other drafting tutorials are written for standard thus this is to help convert the fractions to a  more manageable format. When reading a long MM measurement such as 25.7969 you will want to round the .7969 to .8 thus 25 cm plus 8 mm is what you will find your measurement will have to be for 1 1/64″</li>
          </ul>
