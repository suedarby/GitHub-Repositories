                        <p class="card-text">This was a concept to completion system developed to assist the Complaince team with the Settings project. Settings required a survey (developed previously with Survey Monkey - no involvement), and on site or desk reviews of 800+ providers who provided specific Home &amp; Community Based Waiver services. The system is designed to collect the on site review data, format it within notification letters, gather corrective action responses, provide additional feedback to the provider if needed including additional changes or a go ahead for their plan. It includes a tracker for each provider's site location. One provider can have 90+ locations and each had to have a visit and cite exactly what was wrong with the location and how to correct it. </p>
                        <p>By the end of the project there was a template spreadsheet for each location, 5 different letters, and a spreadsheet with a custom macro for emailing notifications in editable PDF format that worked with Outlook. As a bonus I also developed a tracking dashboard that updated based on the status of each provider and gave statistics to make management's task of reporting each month easier.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">The Certification Checklist started as a bulleted list in Word as a work aid for the professionals working Certification Applications. Upon regulation changes in 2013 a programmed Excel tool was built and later bequeathed to my care for updating. It was several hundred lines of Visual Basic code and usually required up to a full day of planning for changes and then going through the code to make changes.</p>
                        <p> When I left the State in December of 2017 my literal last project was to create from scratch a simplified version of the checklist that would be easy enough for my remaining co-workers to maintain. I hit save and send as I was heading to my going away party!</p>

                        <p class="card-text">Just the basic outline of what the hard file contained and in what order it was planned in. I was so efficient at putting files together that I was once able to put a series of files together with my eyes closed! (I had a bad migraine at the time) The system worked flawlessly for all 9 files I had to do. I already done the work to place the tabs for each section and then use the tabs to assemble the files. The biggest challenge was that the 9 files were part of a file grouping for the different locations for one of the largest providers!</p>
                        <p>The next day I checked each one just to be sure and each file was perfect.</p>
